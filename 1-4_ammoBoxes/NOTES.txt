config.cpp contains the classes relating to the box names and contents. This file will need heavy editing!

default loadouts are 50% done. Cross check them with config.cpp to see where recon stuff is being called and pull that shit out out of config.cpp (if I havent already done that....its 0109 and I'm fucking tired). Also check to see what shit I need in vehicles boxes. Whatever isn't needed needs to be pulled out from defaultloadouts folder.

NEED TO CROSS CHECK cratefunctions, cratemodel, cratesigns and loadoutmanager. Pull out any 24thmar references. I've removed quite a few boxes and signs form config.cpp, so quite a few things will need to be pulled out from the various files.
